Automatically generate the Post Thumbnail (Featured Image) from the first image in any post or any custom post type, but only if Post Thumbnail is not set manually.

== Description ==

Welcome to Simple Auto Post Thumbnail.

This plugin will generate a default featured image from the first image it can find in your post's content, and that is it!

This is a fork of Auto Post Thumbnail version 3.4.1. 

If you need functionality from that greatly enhanced plugin, go to https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-post-thumbnail/ .

This plugin will continue as the 'simple' version (hence the name).

Note that I 'scooped out' the functionality that lets you scan an entire site for missing thumbnails.

This plugin may work on Wordpress versions 4.9.11, but I am not going to verify that. It originally worked on Wordpress 3.6.1 and newer, and I did not touch much code other than fixing a few bugs and doing a lot of clean-up, so ... it might still work for those versions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload directory 'simple-auto-post-thumbnail' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Sorry, no more steps. :)

== Changelog ==

= 0.1 =
First release of this fork.
