There were two bug in Auto Post Thumbnail that caused it to stop generating thumbnails at some point;  maybe after either a Wordpress or a PHP update? 

First, the plugin tried to find the id of images that had already been uploaded, but the regular expression that tried to find the first image in the body of a post did not match the entire IMG tag and would therefore often skip the class name that contained the IMG id.

Second, for externally hosted images, but also for images for which it was unable to find an id, further processing would be handed to a function called apt_generate_post_thumb(), which amongst others would try to determine if the current user was allowed to upload images. 

It did this by calling a WP function called get_allowed_mime_types() and compare its output to the filename extension of the image (.jpg, .png, .gif and so on). 

The plugin seemed to work on the assumption that get_allowed_mime_types() returns an array of extensions, except it doesn't, not quite. The function get_allowed_mime_types() returns an array of regular expressions against which an extension can be matched. Often, the regular expression is exactly the same as the extension (for example 'gif', 'png') and then a straight comparison $regex === $extension works, but some cases, for example 'jpg|jpeg|jpe' require a different type of test, e.g. preg_match( '/' . $regex . '/', $extension).

Fixing both bugs made the plugin generate thumbnails again, with an added bonus of no longer uploading images that the site already knows about.
